IMPACT OF GENERATIVE AI ON DEVELOPERS USING A TOPIC MODELLING AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF REDDIT DATA


ABSTRACT

The aim of this research is to understand developer perceptions of the recent innovation of Generative AI. To do this, this study answers how generative AI is perceived by developers, has it proven effective in augmenting processes and to what extent its implementation has brought about challenges in accuracy and security. The methodology utilised in this study includes LDA topic modelling and sentiment analysis to uncover latent topics and their sentiment throughout popular developer subreddits using Reddit data. The findings reveal an overwhelmingly positive perception of GenAI, with minimal evidence of negativity, although concerns for the future do exist, particularly job security. The implications of this study include a positive adoption in accordance with adoption frameworks with the view that as inflated expectations and hype realign with reality, a wider and more nuanced perspective of the technology will be apparent. Furthermore, GenAI is likely to alleviate talent shortages within specialised roles by lowering entry barriers, while simultaneously also displacing high skilled roles, requiring upskilling.
